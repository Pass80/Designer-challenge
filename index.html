            <p>
                Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
                could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I
                wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
                only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for
                some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
                thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made
                a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem
                was that the result was just something nice and did not solve
                any problem.

                        Only when you experience a problem yourself do you
                        understand the frustration of the users and resolve to
                        end it.

                        As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s
                        not finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to
                        accept feedback and learn from it.

                    It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or

                    remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you
                    carefully and pay close attention to your surroundings.

                    It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve
                    these problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your
                    notebook and start writing down all the ideas that come to
                    mind.

                <h4>Design your proposal</h4>
                <p>
                    How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think
                    about features and functionality, and then start designing.
                    Don’t forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use
                    this?
